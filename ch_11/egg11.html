      <h2 class="yellow">Egg 11: Memeory 2.0</h2>
      <p class="problem_yellow">
        We improved Memeory 1.0 and added an insane serverside component. 
        So, no more CSS-tricks. Muahahaha.
        <br>
        Flagbounty for everyone who can solve 10 successive rounds. 
        Time per round is 30 seconds and only 3 missclicks are allowed.
        <br>
        Good game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The memory game at whale.hacking-lab.com:1111 starts off by showing 98 covered up 
        picture cards. A pair of cards is selected by clicking on them. Whenever the pair
        matches, it is left open, otherwise the cards are covered again after a short time. 
        The goal is to uncover the whole deck within 30 seconds, with only 3 mistakes 
        permitted. Obviously, this is beyond superhuman and requires cheating.
      </p>
      <img src="img/memory.png" class="centered" width="700">
      <p>
        Every card is represented as a html figure containing both the hidden image and 
        the backside cover.
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;figure id="legespiel_card_82"&gt;
    &lt;a href="#card_82"&gt;
        &lt;img class="boxFront" src="./pic/83" /&gt;
        &lt;img class="boxWhite" src="/assets/images/shadow_card.png" /&gt;
        &lt;img class="boxBack" src="/assets/images/back.jpg"  /&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;img class="boxStretch" src="/assets/images/shim.gif" /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;</pre>
        The client side code governing the game mechanics is in a large JavaScript file 
        /assets/javascripts/main.js, which looks very painful to work through. The source 
        also contains a portion of JavaScript which determines behaviour and invites
        manipulation:
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-js">            
window.game = S.game('.moduleLegespiel', {
    clickCount : false,   //if clicks should be counted or not 
                          //(one click represents a attempt of clicking a pair)
    clickLimit : 3,       //limit of clicks
    gameLimitTime : null, //if game has a limit of time in seconds, if null no limit
    showOnStart : false,  //if the cards should be visible for the first time
    startDelay : 1500
});</pre>
        The first idea (and probably the intended path) was to save a local copy of the page,
        change showOnStart to True and clickLimit to 3000, and then to play with open cards.
        Sadly, for some reason I cannot understand, this failed to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next idea was to let a python script do the playing. Curiously, loading an image 
        /pic/n (1 &lt;= n &lt;= 98) from the browser would invalidate the game, but doing 
        so via a python script has no consequence. An oversight? Who knows ... <br>
        For each round, the script loads all 98 images, computes their hashes and pairs 
        them up automatically. Then, it submits every pair as a POST. 
      </p>
