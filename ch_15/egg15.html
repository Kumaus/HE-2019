      <h2 class="yellow">Egg 15: Seen in Steem</h2>
      <p class="problem_yellow">
        An unknown person placed a secret note about Hacky Easter 2019 in the Steem blockchain. 
        It happend during Easter 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steem is a blockchain established in 2016 which is used both for a social media network (Steemit) 
        and for a crypto currency. Rather than the usual "proof of work" which requires heavy computation, 
        steem relies on a delegated "proof of stake" consensus protocol, where the creator of the next block 
        is chosen by stake (which could be seen as reputation). As a result, there are no transaction costs,
        and the time between blocks can be very low (around 3 seconds). Steem is among the 5 most active 
        blockchains worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, the Steem blockchain is huge. The blockchain is intended for data verification and not 
        for data retrieval, which is very inefficient. Usually, to find data one should consult a 
        database containing data from all blocks and continuously updated. While there are different searchable 
        front-ends of differing quality, an openly accessible SQL project was discontinued. Several paid services 
        exist, but that is cheating, isn't it? 
      </p>
      <p>
        After quite a bit of searching for generic data access front-ends, I gave up and decided to download the 
        portion of the blockchain corresponding to 1. April 2018 (Easter sunday). 1 GB for only one day ... 
        To find the appropriate block numbers, I used the 
        <a href="https://steemworld.org/block/21167975">steemworld API</a>
        to show block characteristic data. We need to consider 30000 blocks in the range 
        21170000 - 21200000
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a useful python package for interactions with the steem blockchain: 
        <a href="https://github.com/steemit/steem-python">steem-python</a>. 
        This package offers functions for accessing all blockchain content, but because I knew 
        nothing except a date, I opted to download the relevant blocks completely and to search 
        them locally. The script below does that, grabbing blocks in groups of 1000 
        before saving them as a JSON structure:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-py"> 
from steem import Steem
from steem.blockchain import Blockchain

class SteemNode:
    def __init__(self, block, block_count, operation):
        self.block = block
        self.end_block = block_count + self.block - 1
        self.operation = operation
        self.nodes = ['https://rpc.buildteam.io', 'https://api.steemit.com',
                      'https://rpc.steemviz.com']
        self.steem = Steem(nodes=self.nodes)
        self.b = Blockchain(self.steem)

        self.easter = dict()
        print('Booted\nConnected to: {}'.format(self.nodes[0]))

    def run(self):
        run = True
        while run:
            try:
                stream = self.b.stream_from(start_block=self.block,
                                            end_block=self.end_block,
                                            full_blocks=True)
                for block in stream:
                    if block['timestamp'].startswith('2018-04-01T'):
                        self.easter[self.block] = block

                    if self.block == self.end_block:
                        run = False
                    else:
                        self.block += 1
            except Exception as e:
                continue

    def save(self, easter_file):
        with open(easter_file, 'w') as fh:
            json.dump(self.easter, fh)

for start_block in range(21170000, 21200000, 1000):
    print(start_block)
    steem_node = SteemNode(start_block, 1000, "transfer")
    steem_node.run()
    print("... saving")
    steem_node.save("easter_" + str(start_block // 1000) + ".json")</pre>
      <p>
        Once the block download was complete, a brutal raw text search for "Hacky" identified the
        correct transaction:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
for n in range(21170, 21200):
    with open("blockchain/easter_" + str(n) + ".json", "r") as fh:
        block_list = fh.read()
    index = block_list.find("Hacky")
    if index > -1:
        print("block", n, "index", index)
        print(block_list[index-500: index+500])</pre>

        The secret enty is a transfer transaction from darkstar-42 to ctf with a memo:
        <code>Hacky Easter 2019 takes place between April and May 2019. Take a note: 
        nomoneynobunny</code>. So, the password is <b>nomoneynobunny</b>. Which begs 
        the question whether darkstar's transfer of 0.001 SBD was enough to merit 
        even the smallest of bunnies ...
