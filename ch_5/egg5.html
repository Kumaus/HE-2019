    <h2 class="green">Egg 5: Call for Papers</h2>
    <p class="problem_green">
      Please read and review my CFP document, for the upcoming IAPLI Symposium.
      <br>
      I didn't write it myself, but used some artificial intelligence.
      <br>
      What do you think about it?
    </p>
    <p>
      The document <b>IAPLI_Conference.docx</b> attached to the challenge is 
      supposed to be a call for papers (CFP) for a conference. The challenge
      description and the mostly nonsensical contents of the document point 
      towards text steganography. Staring at the text brings no illumination,
      so additional evidence is needed.

      docx documents are actually zip files in disguise. After changing the
      extension to .zip, the document tree can be opened and examined.  
      According to the challenge description, the document was written
      by an AI. Which one? <b>IAPLI_conference &rarr; docProps &rarr; core.xml</b> 
      names the document creator as <b>SCIpher</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      A search for SCIpher brings a number of interesting hits. My favourite is
      <a href="go.nature.com/SCIPHER">SCIPHER</a> by nature magazine, "an AI 
      construct created in a secret basement by the mavens of Nature's editorial 
      team". Well worth the visit!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      But sadly, that's not quite it ... the target is 
      <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/archive/scigen/scipher.html">
      SCIpher - A Scholarly Message Encoder</a> from MIT, also a fun read. 
      To extract the secret message, all one needs to do is copy and past 
      the document contents into the appropriate box. Out comes the address
      of an egg:
