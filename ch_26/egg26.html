    <h2 class="blue">Egg 26: Hidden Egg 2</h2>
    <p class="problem_blue">
      A stylish blue egg is hidden somewhere here on the web server. Go catch it!
    </p>

    <p>
      The usual suspects for "somewhere on the server" are the /images, /js and /css 
      folders, and good old robots.txt. Unfortunately, those folders are all protected,
      and robots.txt just brings up<br>
      <code>Nothing here, really. Had enough robots.txt challenges.</code>
    </p>

      The next place to search is the named js and css files loaded by the 
      different pages. But there's a strange thing: no css links are visible 
      in the page sources! Chief suspect: evil JavaScript trickery! This makes

      The long slog through the different css files on the list is finally 
      rewarded in <b>/css/source-sans-pro.css</b>: an interesting font is 
      defined as last entry.
      <pre class="prettyprint">
@font-face {
    font-family: 'Egg26';
    font-weight: 400;
    font-style: normal;
    font-stretch: normal;
    src: local('Egg26'),
    local('Egg26'),
    url('../fonts/TTF/Egg26.ttf') format('truetype');
}</pre>
      The supposed font file <b>/fonts/TTF/Egg26.ttf</b> turns out to be a 
      png image file in disguise, and changing the extension reveals the egg.
