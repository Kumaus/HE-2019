      This egg was quite the journey. The small QR codes decode to "remove me". 
      If one does that and replaces the position and alignment squares in the 
      large QR, it reads "Isn't that a bit too easy?". Reverse gear ...

      Analysis of the jpg image file, for exampel with 
      <a href="http://www.caesum.com/handbook/stego.htm">Stegsolve</a> by Caesum
      or by looking for the JPG termination sequence 0xFF 0xD9, shows
      that there is additional material behind the image:
      <table class="listing">
        <tr>
          <td>0 - 0x11351</td>
          <td>
            Original image of beautified QR code
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0x11352 - 0x226223</td>
          <td>
            Another JPG file with missing header, 
            which looks remarkably similar to the first.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0x226224 - 0x22886</td>
          <td>
            611 bytes of utf-8, which shows another small QR code
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </p>
    <img src="img/modernart_1.jpg" style="height:180px; margin-left:10px;">>
    <img src="img/modernart_2.jpg" style="height:180px; margin-left:10px;">
    <img src="img/modernart_3.png" style="height:150px; margin-left:10px;">
    <p>
      The third QR code (utf-8 encoded) simply reads <b>AES-128</b>. <br>
      The header of the second JPG is easily repaired, by copying the leading 
      0xB7 bytes from the first JPG. It looks very similar to the first, but 
      shows some strange distortions, indicating content which shouldn't be there.
      A bytewise comparison with the first JPG identifies the culprits:
      <table class="listing">
        <tr>
          <td>0xA995 - 0xA9B6</td>
          <td>(E7EF085CEBFCE8ED93410ACF169B226A)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>0xD974 - 0xD95C</td>
          <td>(KEY=1857304593749584)</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      Decrypting this with AES-128 in ECB-mode (for example with 
      <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef">CyberChef</a>) gives the flag:<br>
      <b>Ju5t_An_1mag3</b>
