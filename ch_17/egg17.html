      <h2 class="yellow">Egg 17: New Egg Design</h2>
      <p class="problem_yellow">
        Thumper is looking for a new design for his eggs. He tried several filters with his 
        graphics program, but unfortunately the QR codes got unreadable. Can you help him?! 
      </p>

        This challenge was very misleading, and the hint added later did not help much 
        to clarify. The left side image shows a honeycomb-type camera filter, and the 
        right an electonic high pass filter, which also exists as optical filter variant.
        So, all hints seemed to point to some clever graphical filtering technique to be
        applied to the left side image, consistent with normal usage of the term. 
        Unfortunately, the information content turns out to be too low to do anything. 
        A lot of time was wasted before a hint form keep3r via brp64 (thanks to both!) 
        finally opened my eyes: "Check the PNG specs!"
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that PNG specifies several lossless preprocessing methods for images 
        in order to improve the compression ratio. This is also referred to as filter.
        Now if one has seen this before, this may be obvious, but for normal mortals, 
        this is very hard to guess from the information provided. It is unfortunate that 
        this challenge became quite frustrating in that way, because the idea and execution
        is really excellent!

        Enough grumping. According to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/">PNG specification</a>,
        every PNG file is structured as a series of <b>chunks</b>: <code>IHDR, gAMA, cHRM, IDAT</code>
        and many more. PNG uses a lossless compression algorithm, the output of which is stored 
        in IDAT image data chunks. The properties of the image and the type of processing used 
        are stored in the IHDR header chunk. Its contents: 
        <pre>
        IHDR Chunk: 
            Data length = 13 bytes 
            CRC = 7dd4be95 
                Width: 1e0 (480)
                Height: 1e0 (480) 
                Bit Depth: 8 
                Color Type: 6 (RGB + Alpha) 
                Compression Method: 0 (deflate) 
                Filter Method: 0 (adaptive) 
                Interlace Method: 0 (none)  
        </pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Without interlacing, the process of PNG image encoding is roughly as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Scanline serialisation:</b> Separate the image into rows of pixels, each of which is 
            serialized according to colour type and bit depth. In our case (RGBA 8 bit), this requires 4 byte.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Filtering:</b> For each scanline (= image row) a filter type is selected which is used to 
            improve its compression characteristics. The filter performs for each pixel a reversible operation 
            on each colour channel separately, involving the pixel to the left, the pixel above and the pixel 
            diagonally above and left. Five different filter types can be used, generally involving some form 
            of difference operation. The choice of best filter type depends on the image and is usually made 
            heuristically. The filter type is placed at the head of the transformed scanline.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Compression:</b> The scanlines are written in sequence, and a lossless compression method 
            (deflate) is applied to the stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Chunking:</b> The compressed datastream is sliced into IDAT chunks to make it manageable. 
          </li>
        </ol>
        <img src="img/filtering.png" class="centered" width="600">

      <p>
        So much for the theory. It seems that information can be hidden in the choice of filter type for each 
        row, which is a really clever idea! In order to get at the filter type bytes, one needs to reverse the 
        compression and chunking steps. There are probably tools out there which do this, but it can also be 
        done without too much trouble from first principles:

import zlib
import struct

class PNG:
    def __init__(self, png_file):
        with open(png_file, 'rb') as fh:
            self.raw = fh.read()
        # read PNG chunks
        self.chunks = dict()
        pos = 0x08
        while "IEND" not in self.chunks:
            length = struct.unpack(">I", self.raw[pos: pos+4])[0]
            name = b''.join(struct.unpack("cccc", self.raw[pos+4: pos+8])).decode()
            payload = self.raw[pos+8: pos+8+length]
            pos += 8 + length + 4
            if name not in self.chunks:
                self.chunks[name] = [payload]
            else:
                self.chunks[name].append(payload)

    def decmpress_idat(self):
        idat = bytearray()
        for c in self.chunks['IDAT']:
            idat.extend(c)
        return zlib.decompress(idat)


# Decompress IDAT chunks
png = PNG("eggdesign.png")
img = png.decmpress_idat()

# Collect filter byte at start of every scanline
filter_bytes = [img[n] for n in range(0, len(img), 4 * 480 + 1)]
print(filter_bytes)

# read as ASCII
filter_bin = [map(str, filter_bytes[n:n+8]) for n in range(0, len(filter_bytes), 8)]
filter_ascii = [chr(int(''.join(x), 2)) for x in filter_bin]
print(''.join(filter_ascii))</pre>
      <p>
        The script is built around a class PNG which is initialized with a PNG image file.
        Initialisation pulls apart this image file into it scomponent chunks. Each chunk type 
        is stored as a list, so that multiple occurences are possible. The member function 
        <code>decompress_idat()</code> combines the contents of the IDAT chunks into a long
        byte-array and uses ZLIB decompress to deflate it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This results in a sequence of scanlines, each 4*480 + 1 bytes long 
        (pixel size * image width + filter type). Extracting the filter type gives a long
        sequence of 0 and 1:<br>
        <code>[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, ... 0, 0, 0]</code><br>
        This looks like the binary representation of ASCII characters. Converting it back 
        produces the flag:<br>
        <code>Congratulation, here is your flag: <b>he19-TKii-2aVa-cKJo-9QCj</b> </code>
